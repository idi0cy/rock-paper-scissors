# rock-paper-scissors
A simple game of rock paper scissors played as of now through the Javascript console. This game was developed by idi0cy as a part of the Odin project curriculum. Thank you for visiting.

Unfortunatley, commits in this project were uncommon due to the developer being an absolute buffoon and forgetting to until finishing the entire project.
